BrainAGE
Short:
The brain age is estimated by looking at brain images from a lot of people and then using that information to estimate the brain age of a new person. The advantage of brain age is that it can show if a person's brain is aging faster or slower than normal. This new method is exciting because it has the potential to help us better understand the aging process. It could also help us develop better interventions to prevent or delay the onset of age-related diseases.

Long:
The brain age is estimated by training a machine learning approach on brain images from a large number of subjects, and then using that trained approach to estimate the brain age of a new subject. The advantage of brain age is that it aggregates the complex, multidimensional aging pattern throughout the whole brain into in one single value. This value is the estimated brain age. If the estimated age is higher than the chronological age, a positive brain age gap estimation (BrainAGE) score indicates accelerated atrophy and is considered a risk factor for conversion to AD.

There are many potential applications of this new method of brain age estimation. For example, it could be used to help identify individuals at risk for Alzheimer's disease or other age-related diseases. This new method is exciting because it has the potential to help us better understand the aging process. It could also help us develop better interventions to prevent or delay the onset of age-related diseases.

The new method of brain age estimation is a promising new tool that could significantly contribute to understanding the human brain. This new method, which uses structural MRIs to estimate brain age, is already being used by more and more researchers worldwide. The potential applications of this new method are numerous and exciting. This new method has the potential to help us better understand the aging process and identify individuals at risk for age-related diseases. With more research, the new method of brain age estimation could have a major impact on the way we understand and treat age-related diseases.

Plasticity
Short:
The brain is able to change its structure in response to experience, which is called brain plasticity. To study brain plasticity, we can use structural MRIs to detect changes in the brain over time. Structural MRIs allow to look at the gross anatomical structure of the brain with a high detail. By looking at how the structure of the brain changes over time, we can learn about how the brain changes in response to learning.

Long:
Structural brain plasticity refers to the brain's ability to change its physical structure in response to experience. This plasticity is a result of the brain's adaptability to its environment. One way to study brain plasticity is by using structural MRIs to detect changes in the brain over time. Structural MRIs allow to look at the gross anatomical structure of the brain with a high detail. By looking at how the structure of the brain changes over time, scientists can learn about how the brain changes in response to learning.

This research topic is important for the field of neuroimaging because it can help us understand how the brain changes in response to different experiences and how this plasticity contributes to brain function. 

Our findings in the juggler study suggest that the brain is capable of making structural changes in response to environmental demands. This discovery contradicts the traditionally held view that cortical plasticity is associated with functional rather than anatomical changes. The finding that the brain can alter its structure in response to experience has important implications for our understanding of brain plasticity and its role in learning and memory.

In our group, we develop tools to analyze these subtle changes that can be seen over time. By understanding how the brain changes in response to experience, we can learn more about how the brain works and how the brain changes in response to learning.
