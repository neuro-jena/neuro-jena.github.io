- Extract the filled volume of the outer skull using morphological operators
- Dilate the outer skull to estimate the scalp compartment
- Erode the inner skull to estimate the inside of the CSF compartment
- Fill all the compartments with a flood fill algorithm
- Create a boundary for all the filled volumes with one of [these methods](#Triangulation methods)
- **[only for BEMCP]** Create an additional 4th point for each triangle in each triangulated mesh ('solid angle' BEM method)
- Assign the conductivity to each compartment (from literature)
- Projection of the electrodes on the triangulated surface/s
- Check of the direction of the normals (outwards or inwards)
