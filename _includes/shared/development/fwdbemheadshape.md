- load in the points corresponding to each head compartment
- if not available generate a triangulation of the points with one of [these methods](#Triangulation methods)
- **[only for BEMCP]** Create an additional 4th point for each triangle in each triangulated mesh ('solid angle' BEM method)
- Assign the conductivity to each compartment (from literature)
- Projection of the electrodes on the triangulated surface/s
- Check of the direction of the normals (outwards or inwards)
