- With the diverse [triangulation techniques](#Triangulation methods) obtain the points of the triangulated surface around the inner skull volume
- Calculate a plane tangent to the inner skull points
- Determine one point on the non-conductive side of the electrodes
- **[only for the Slab method]** Determine the thickness of the slab (e.g., cortical thickness)
- Electrodes are not allowed to be in the vacuum side, therefore faulty electrodes are automatically reprojected on the plane
